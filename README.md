MAC172 Web Development - Final Project
For my MAC172 final project, I developed an eCommerce website focused on selling video games and consoles. The site includes five main sections: Home, Video Games, Consoles, Deals, and Pre-Owned. I designed it with a colorful, retro-inspired style to make it visually engaging and user-friendly. The goal of the project was to create a platform that offers the topmost video games and consoles at competitive prices, and I focused on both functionality and design to create a smooth browsing experience.
